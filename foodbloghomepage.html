            <p class="paragraph_background paragraph_border">They say there are only five love languages, but I’m here to argue that there are six. Food, the universal romance language that conveys comfort, care and love that defies geographic and demographic boundaries with each bite. I remember vividly the exact moment falling head-over-heels for it, literally. I was younger, think crayons and Sesame Street re-runs, when I was sitting at my mom’s table and I did a full face plant into my creamed sweet potatoes. Some would say I just needed a nap but personally, I believe my first memory of an encounter with food was an omen to how I would approach life, dive head (and stomach) first. Which brings us all to why we’re here.<br><br>
            
            The Foodie is a blog that details where my food love journey has taken me. I have encountered soulmates in the form of fluffy pancakes accompanied by crispy, golden fried chicken drizzled in luscious maple syrup in New York. I have also endured heartbreak of underwhelming and over-cooked chicken carbonara, that I once thought could be the pasta dish of my dreams, in Washington D.C. As a self-proclaimed foodie, I approach every dish with a cleansed pallet, taste buds alert, and a clear mind to make sure every bite gets the full attention it deserves. The purpose of this blog is to take you on the journey of every twist and turn my fork endures in search of the dishes that bursts with love with each mouthful. So I invite you, fellow foodie, to dine with me at this table where experiences, a healthy appetite, and of course a passion for eating is on the menu. I hope you’re just as hungry as I am.</p>
